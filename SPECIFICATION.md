# Snake Game Specification

## 1. Game Overview

### 1.1 Purpose

A classic Snake game implementation that provides an engaging, nostalgic gaming experience with modern technical architecture.

### 1.2 Core Concept

The player controls a snake that moves around a bounded game area, consuming food to grow longer while avoiding collisions with walls and the snake's own body.

### 1.3 Target Platform

- Web-based application
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile devices
- Modern browsers supporting HTML5 Canvas and ES6+

## 2. Game Mechanics

### 2.1 Game Board

- **Default Size**: 20x20 cells (configurable)
- **Boundaries**: Solid walls on all four sides
- **Visual Style**: Clean, minimalist design with clear grid lines

### 2.2 Snake

- **Initial State**:
  - Length: 3 segments
  - Position: Center of the game board
  - Direction: Right (configurable)
- **Movement**:
  - Continuous movement in current direction
  - Cannot reverse into itself
  - One cell per game tick
- **Growth**:
  - Increases by 1 segment when food is consumed
  - New segment appears at the tail
- **Visual Representation**:
